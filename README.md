I've chosen to locally run a docker container with WordPress and MySQL to do my editing/blog writing. I then use the plugin _WP Static Site Generator_ to generate a static version which you can see here.

You get the best of both worlds: the powerful dynamic tooling behind WordPress + the speed, reliability, and security of a static site.

## WIN!
