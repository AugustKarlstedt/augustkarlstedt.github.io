<p>My schedule included</p>



<p><strong><span style="color: #5b9bd5;">CSC 421</span> </strong>&#8211; Applied Algorithms and Structures</p>



<p><strong><span style="color: #ed7d31;">CSC 447</span></strong> &#8211; Concepts of Programming Language</p>



<p><strong><span style="color: #a5a5a5;">CSC 453</span></strong> &#8211; Database Technologies</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s not the interesting part.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s interesting is that I took these courses online and collected data on how long I spent watching each lecture. This let me optimize my study habits and see which courses I needed to devote the most time to. The color corresponds to the color above.</p>


<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSt3soiDqYJNYeM2V1jgVvZmZWJ9_9h4NMJo1ntRV5N6-LbLQ8y6GkLMiCJ7TsbWNeVqfiM4yqtJ_8v/pubchart?oid=578984766&#038;format=interactive" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="450" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>



<p>Right off the bat, I knew that CSC 421 will be taking a majority of my time. A very heavy course: algorithm analysis, design, implementation, NP-completeness, and the like &#8211; things which I know I can get better at.</p>



<p>Overall, for the other two courses, I was saving 80-90% versus being in-class. The materials covered in these courses were not new to me, so I could get by by watching the &#8220;interesting&#8221; parts of the lecture, reading the book, and looking at the slides.</p>



<p>I wound up with an A and an A-, for CSC 447 and CSC 453, respectively.</p>



<p>CSC 421 was one of those courses that is really tough, but you where you learn so much. I probably could have benefited taking this course in-person, but I still managed to save some time. Since this is the first time I&#8217;ve ever recorded data like this, it&#8217;ll be interesting to compare to next quarter (where I am taking an in-person course). All said and done, I wound up with a C+ in CSC 421, bringing my GPA for the quarter to a not-too-shabby 3.33.</p>
