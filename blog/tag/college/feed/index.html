<p>Walking to class this morning is the first time I&#8217;ve ever actually felt college-y. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s different this morning, but the brisk air, morning sun, and overall atmosphere seems&#8230; Different.</p>



<p>Maybe it&#8217;s the realization that this path isn&#8217;t what everyone chooses. I see so many people from when I was younger choosing one of the billions of other paths there are and I believe I&#8217;ve chosen the best one for me.</p>



<p>For the first two years of college (I&#8217;m a junior now), I only took it semi-seriously. To me, it was just something I <em>had</em> to do, not something I <em>wanted</em> to do. I felt most of the classes I had been taking were pointless, and that the idea that college finally lets someone explore the things they are most interested in was false.</p>



<p>I understand now that one cannot look at it as black and white as that. College is a place where, yes, you learn about certain specific things you&#8217;re interested in, but it also shows you that there&#8217;s a world where there&#8217;s so much more to learn, understand, and contemplate that it doesn&#8217;t make sense to ignore it.</p>
