<p>Walking to class this morning is the first time I&#8217;ve ever actually felt college-y. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s different this morning, but the brisk air, morning sun, and overall atmosphere seems&#8230; Different.</p>



<p>Maybe it&#8217;s the realization that this path isn&#8217;t what everyone chooses. I see so many people from when I was younger choosing one of the billions of other paths there are and I believe I&#8217;ve chosen the best one for me.</p>



<p>For the first two years of college (I&#8217;m a junior now), I only took it semi-seriously. To me, it was just something I <em>had</em> to do, not something I <em>wanted</em> to do. I felt most of the classes I had been taking were pointless, and that the idea that college finally lets someone explore the things they are most interested in was false.</p>



<p>I understand now that one cannot look at it as black and white as that. College is a place where, yes, you learn about certain specific things you&#8217;re interested in, but it also shows you that there&#8217;s a world where there&#8217;s so much more to learn, understand, and contemplate that it doesn&#8217;t make sense to ignore it.</p>

<p>Alright so I&#8217;m finally going to discuss the new courses I&#8217;m taking now.</p>



<p>CSC 395 &#8211; Research Colloquium &#8211; I&#8217;m pretty excited about this course. It&#8217;s completely online and every week there will be a lecture by a guest speaker on new work in areas of computing. Hopefully there are some talks relevant to my interests, but nonetheless I love TED talks, so this should be similar.</p>



<p>GAM 341 &#8211; Introduction to Level Design &#8211; Since I&#8217;m majoring in Computer Game Development and focusing on the programming portion of it, I figured I should also get a little more experience in the non-programming&nbsp;parts. We&#8217;re going to be using Unreal Engine 4, which I&#8217;m pretty stoked about!</p>



<p>GAM 376 &#8211; AI for Computer Games &#8211; I&#8217;ve always been interested in artificial intelligence. Actually, in the class I&#8217;ll describe next we&#8217;re discussing AI through a philosophical perspective. I&#8217;ll probably post more on this later. As for this course, I hope we don&#8217;t just use some already-implemented AI algorithms and we can actually write our own. I doubt it though.</p>



<p>PHL 242 &#8211; Philosophy &amp; Technology &#8211; We&#8217;re discussing what technology actually <i>is</i>. Admittedly, when asked this question I thought it was going to be easy to define. I was horribly wrong. While it isn&#8217;t required, I may read the recommended material, &#8220;War in the Age of Intelligent Machines&#8221; by Manuel De Landa. We read the first chapter and thinking about how a robot historian would describe its history is something that made me extremely intrigued.</p>



<p>SOC 281 &#8211; Sociology of Rock Music &#8211; This is kind of weird, yes, and I know that. It fulfills some requirement that I needed to complete, so hey why not? We&#8217;re going to trace Rock Music from the beginning to now, and I&#8217;m thinking I&#8217;ll learn a lot. The professor asked in the first day of class what we knew about rock. While I do know some stuff, and I listen to rock all the time, I wrote that I had no knowledge of rock. I think this will benefit me because starting with a blank-ish slate should be fun.</p>



<p>Anyhow, I wasn&#8217;t going to take these classes and considered switching majors. I&#8217;ll explain why in the next post.</p>
